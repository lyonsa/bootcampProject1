## Game Logic
- Homepage
  - Shows users waiting (0/2, 1/2)
  - Shows start button
  - Has banner
- Waiting Screen
  - User has to wait if there is no other user
  - Fun waiting icon that indicates still connected and looking???
- Pick Category Screen
  - Shows buttons for the categories (random selected player needs to pick one)
  - User attributes show
    - Name
    - Profile picture
    - Scores for round and forever -‚Äù({foreverScore (roundScore)}"
  - Nice to have: when the selecting user hovers over a category, the other user can see that (think stage selection in fighting game)
- In Game
  - User attributes maintain position
    - Question is shown with four options
  - (Make sure that users cannot see each others hover now)
  - On selection:
    - First user
      - Immediately display if correct/incorrect
        - Div turns red/green
        - Displays "Correct/Incorrect"
      - Countdown for time remaining moves to 3 when the 2nd user selects
    - Second user
      - immediately display if correct/incorrect
      - countdown for time also sets to 3 so they have time to see the correct/incorrect option
  - Note: We don't need a "correct/incorrect" phase outside of the questions with this flow
- After Questions
  - 30 second timer until kicking users back to the start if no selection below
  - Shows winner with score (big and center)
  - Shows loser with score (below like a loser)
  - Again button
    - If selected by both, both users are kicked to the category screen and the user picks
    - If only one selects place them back in the waiting area
  - Main menu button
    - kicks both users back to the home screen
